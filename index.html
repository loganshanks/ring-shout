    Welcome to RINGSHOUT, a motherboard crafted by Playing in Excess. Our goal is to bring together Black artists, creatives, intellectuals, cultural workers, and healers to collaborate on community and creative projects. In the future, RINGSHOUT aspires to serve as a resource for bringing together African diasporic communities, fostering a collective space for Black transnational community and artistic work. 
    
    Playing in Excess is on a journey of imaginative worldbuilding expansion. We actively engage in research, community-building, and cultural production experimentation
    
    Through research, community-building, and artistic and cultural production, Playing in Excess is seeking to assist in the pre-production and post-production tasks of photoshoots, installations, image-creation, music videos,  art-writing, and film, etc. 
    extending our support to pre-production and post-production tasks across various creative realms such as photoshoots, installations, image creation, music videos, art-writing, film, and more. 
    
    Playing in Excess began as a senior thesis project, Playing in Excess: Black Femme Aesthetics and Interiority and has developed into a creative practice and collective, created by multi hyphenated Artist-Scholar Logan Shanks who is dedicated to stewarding Black feminist queer creative artistic spaces. Logan specializes in worldbuilding Black transnational diasporic frameworks and Black feminist visual cultures and aesthetics.
